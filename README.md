# Mean_Var_Std_Calc

In this project, I created two Python files that talk with each other. In main.py, the user can implement any list, of any size they would like. From there it communicates with mean_var_std.py and runs the calculations, giving the user the sample statistics for the list of numbers that they provide. test_module.py simply runs the code to ensure it works and is accurate. 





** NOTE
*** These three code files came from a template provided by freeCodeCamp. Although main.py and test_module.py are largely unmodified, the code in mean_var_std.py is mine and of my own creation.
